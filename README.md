## (IEEE Access'2024) BioBridge: Unified Bio Embeddings with Bridging Modality in Code-Switched EMR.

This repository contains the code and proposed BioBridge for our paper [BioBridge: Unified Bio-Embedding With Bridging Modality in Code-Switched EMR](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10693433).


### Installation ### 
We recommend setting up a conda environment for the project:
```
conda create --name=BioBridge python=3.8
conda activate BioBridge

git clone https://github.com/jjy961228/BioBridge.git
pip install -r BioBridge/requirements.txt
```
